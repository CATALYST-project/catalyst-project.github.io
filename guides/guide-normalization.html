**1 Upload FCS**

This can be a single or multiple FCS files of the measurement data you wish to normalize. Note that every file that is uploaded will require gating. If you have many samples, it is thence recommended to concatenate them prior to normalization.

**2 Select the normalization baseline**

Files may be normalized to either the median level of the input data, or to that of previously exported beads.

**3 Specify which beads were used**

**4 Bead gating**

Once beads have been selected, bead vs. DNA scatters will be rendered, and you may brush points to gate bead populations. When all gates have been drawn, finalize them by pressing <img src="screenshots/normalization/gateButton.png" alt="Drawing" style="display:inline-block; height:20px"/>.

**Propagating / downloading data**

The right most box will display the percentage of events that were identified as beads and the fraction of samples that have been gated. At this point, you may directly "Go to compensation", or download intermediate results.

**Bead removal**

When "▢ Should beads be removed?" is checked, bead vs. bead scatters color coded by mahalanobis distance from identified beads will be displayed. Select a cutoff below which events should be remove by dragging the slider and comfirm it by pressing "Apply".
